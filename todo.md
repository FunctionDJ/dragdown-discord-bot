functions:

- /move displays the basic image, links to the hitbox animation, shows frame data, can alternate between modes via dropdown, should include the first line of the basic description if feasible (might need to consider how to store this in a separate table potentially)
- /hit displays the basic hit data in the context of the move mode probably
- /mu char1 char2 move hit shows the knockdown %, CC%, etc for it, similar to how mu page does it
- /tech char1 would show off a tech explanation from a character
